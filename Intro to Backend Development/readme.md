# Introduction to Backend

## Module 1 Learnings:
- Mutiple devices are connected through network switch(NS), interconnection of multiple NS is called INTERNET
- Webservers handle requests and are comprised of software and hardware components

- Website>Webpages --> A website is composed of several webpages(collection of images, text, other resources)

## Internet Protocols:
- IPv4 & IPv6 
- IP Packet: IP header and IP Data
- So get data in order, IP payload has to follow protocol TCP and there's another i.e UDP

- What is HTTP: Hyper Text TP, it helps the browser to exchange information like websites/webpages,etc from the webservers

- HTTPS --> S is for encryption, we save things safely

## What are Webpages, Websites and WebApplications? 

- A Webpage may be a page build with Html,css and js and shows some information and content
- A Website may have several Webpages
- WebApplications are more interaction based they show dynamic content and is more personalized on the other hand the websites are more of informative and less in interactivity and dynamic content. 

## What are Libraties and FrameWorks ? 
- A library is a resuable piece of code and FrameWorks containts a set of libraries . Frameworks are built upon specified libraries that the framework is compatible with.

## What are APIs and what are RESTful/REST APIs?

- API stands for Application Programming Interface. It allows different software applications to communicate with each other.
- REST stands for Representational State Transfer. RESTful APIs are based on REST principles, which use standard HTTP methods and are stateless, meaning each request from a client to a server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request.
- They serve as the middleware/gateway between the browser and the server.
- The REST APIs are based on REST principles.

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create large web applications that can update and render efficiently in response to data changes. React is component-based, meaning the UI is divided into reusable components, each managing its own state. It was developed by Facebook and is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies.

Key features of React include:
- Declarative: React makes it easy to create interactive UIs by designing simple views for each state in your application.
- Component-Based: Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs.
- Learn Once, Write Anywhere: You can develop new features in React without rewriting existing code. React can also render on the server using Node and power mobile apps using React Native.
- Virtual DOM: React uses a virtual DOM to optimize updates and rendering, making applications faster and more efficient.

React is widely used for building single-page applications (SPAs) and is known for its performance and scalability.


## What is Virtual DOM? 

The Virtual DOM (VDOM) is a concept used in libraries like React to optimize the rendering process of web applications. Here's a brief explanation:

What is Virtual DOM?
The Virtual DOM is an in-memory representation of the real DOM elements generated by a web application. It is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM that allows for efficient updates and rendering. When the state of an application changes, the Virtual DOM is updated first instead of the real DOM. The differences between the previous and current Virtual DOM are then calculated, and only the necessary changes are applied to the real DOM. This process is known as "reconciliation."

Benefits of Virtual DOM
Performance: Updating the Virtual DOM is faster than updating the real DOM because it minimizes the number of direct manipulations to the real DOM.
Efficiency: By calculating the differences (diffing) between the old and new Virtual DOM, only the necessary updates are made, reducing the amount of work the browser has to do.
Abstraction: The Virtual DOM provides a simpler programming model by abstracting away the complexities of direct DOM manipulation.
Example
Here's a simple example to illustrate how the Virtual DOM works in a React component:

'''
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Counter;
'''

In this example, when the button is clicked, the state (count) is updated. React updates the Virtual DOM first, calculates the differences, and then updates only the necessary parts of the real DOM.
