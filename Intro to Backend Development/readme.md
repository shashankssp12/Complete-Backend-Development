## Internet Protocols:
- IPv4 & IPv6

## What are Webpages, Websites and WebApplications? 

- A Webpage may be a page build with Html,css and js and shows some information and content
- A Website may have several Webpages
- WebApplications are more interaction based they show dynamic content and is more personalized on the other hand the websites are more of informative and less in interactivity and dynamic content. 

## What are Libraties and FrameWorks ? 
- A library is a resuable piece of code and FrameWorks containts a set of libraries . Frameworks are built upon specified libraries that the framework is compatible with.

## What are APIs and what are RESTful/REST APIs?

- API stands for Application Programming Interface. It allows different software applications to communicate with each other.
- REST stands for Representational State Transfer. RESTful APIs are based on REST principles, which use standard HTTP methods and are stateless, meaning each request from a client to a server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request.
- They serve as the middleware/gateway between the browser and the server.
- The REST APIs are based on REST principles.
