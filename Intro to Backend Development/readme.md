# Introduction to Backend

## Module 1 Learnings:
- Mutiple devices are connected through network switch(NS), interconnection of multiple NS is called INTERNET
- Webservers handle requests and are comprised of software and hardware components

- Website>Webpages --> A website is composed of several webpages(collection of images, text, other resources)

## Internet Protocols:
- IPv4 & IPv6 
- IP Packet: IP header and IP Data
- So get data in order, IP payload has to follow protocol TCP and there's another i.e UDP

- What is HTTP: Hyper Text TP, it helps the browser to exchange information like websites/webpages,etc from the webservers

- HTTPS --> S is for encryption, we save things safely

## What are Webpages, Websites and WebApplications? 

- A Webpage may be a page build with Html,css and js and shows some information and content
- A Website may have several Webpages
- WebApplications are more interaction based they show dynamic content and is more personalized on the other hand the websites are more of informative and less in interactivity and dynamic content. 

## What are Libraties and FrameWorks ? 
- A library is a resuable piece of code and FrameWorks containts a set of libraries . Frameworks are built upon specified libraries that the framework is compatible with.

## What are APIs and what are RESTful/REST APIs?

- API stands for Application Programming Interface. It allows different software applications to communicate with each other.
- REST stands for Representational State Transfer. RESTful APIs are based on REST principles, which use standard HTTP methods and are stateless, meaning each request from a client to a server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request.
- They serve as the middleware/gateway between the browser and the server.
- The REST APIs are based on REST principles.

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create large web applications that can update and render efficiently in response to data changes. React is component-based, meaning the UI is divided into reusable components, each managing its own state. It was developed by Facebook and is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies.

Key features of React include:
- Declarative: React makes it easy to create interactive UIs by designing simple views for each state in your application.
- Component-Based: Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs.
- Learn Once, Write Anywhere: You can develop new features in React without rewriting existing code. React can also render on the server using Node and power mobile apps using React Native.
- Virtual DOM: React uses a virtual DOM to optimize updates and rendering, making applications faster and more efficient.

React is widely used for building single-page applications (SPAs) and is known for its performance and scalability.
